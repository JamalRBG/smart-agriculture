      There are four sessions and in each sessions. We shall discuss on 
      using different technologies that have been proven not only to make agricultural activities easier to perform 
      but also increase the efficiency in agriculture as a general and thus leading to maximum yield of agricultural products both in farming sector and in the animal keeping sector or livestock keeping.

    <h1 class="abouth1"> SESSION 1.</h1>
    <P> 
     In this session we shall discuss on how to use drones in our agriculture activities mainly focused on outside farming.
     <br>
     This is mostly suitable on medium and  large scale farming as it simplifies the working process
     <br> The drones can be used for several purposes such as:
     <ul>
      <li> Irrigation purposes</li>
      <li> Planning for future events by taking aerial photographs and studying the landscapes. </li>
      <li> Realeasing medicines to crops in need with efficiency in time and the the in the task itself.</li>
      <li> Last, it can also be used in the transportation of materials used in the field and also transporting of the harvested crops from the fields to the storage planned area.</li>

     </ul>

     Also in this session we will discuss on how to use the drones,from their settings before they fly to the moment they start flying and how to maintain while on air.

    <h1 class="abouth2">SESSION 2.</h1>
    <p>
      In the second session we shall discuss on green house farming, aslo called the "The Inside Farming".It is in this section that we will know the answer to the great question," How do i begin Green-house farming."
      By starting with a simple definition, A green house is a special structure that is built with the purpose of housing plants of a wide variety,
       with the aim of regulating the aspects of the weather that truly in one way or the other affect the growth of plants.
      The main aspects that are mainly focused on are temperature, humidity and sunshine.
      <br>
      It is in after this session that one will be able to build his/her own  complete green house,
       maintain it and finally be able to use it for aim of developing different sets of crop(s) with maximum effectiveness and efficiency without forgetting maximing profits as well. 
      <br>
        Just to mention a few, the advantages of using green house in your crop cultivation is as follows below.
        <ul>
          <li> First and foremost, it is quite effective and efficient in pest control. This is because the crops being housed helps to prevent contact from outside pests. </li>
          <li> Second, it gives man total control of the weather. When properly built, 
            the green house can maintain a constant aspect(s) of weather such as temperature and humidity set by man even 
            when the outside weather changes, the inside remains fairly constant.</li>
            <li> Lastly,its quite effective and efficient as it allows a wide variety of crops to be grown all together in one green house.
              But also its quite effective in the maximum yield of crop products.
            </li>
        </ul>

  <div class="aboutsection3"><img src="images02/tractor3.jpeg" alt="Tractor Irrigation Image" class="tractor3-image" >

    <h1 class="abouth3"> SESSION 3.</h1>
    <p>

      In this third session, will be for anyone and everyone who is intrigued and attracted in large-scale farming.
      <br>
      It is in session that one will know the smart way of performing large scale farming as it is solely done for profit purposes
       thus one has to be very careful on how to prepare, maintaon and execute large scale farming.
       <br>

       Large scale farming is quite often associated with different technological equipmnets as it involves the use of heavy machinery such as tractors and large scale irrigation schemes
        as it is performed on a large piece of land hence the name Large scale farming.
        <br>
        Hence, one will gain knowledge on how to use and maintain the heavy machineries such as the tractors while performing the large scale farming.
        <br>
        One will also gain the knowledge of how to setup and maintain large scale irrigation systems, that will enable him/her not only irrigate a large piece of land easily and simultaneously
         but also be able to spray medicine, nutrients required and/or pestscides for pest control simultaneously over a large piece of land.

  <div class="aboutsection4"><img src="images02/cows1.jpg" alt="Cows on A Ranch Image" class="cows1-image" >

    <h1 class="abouth4">SESSION 4.</h1>
    <p>

      In this last session, we shall close the seminar with discussing dairy cattle keeping commonly reggered to as "Livestock-keeping".
      <br>
      We shall put the main focus on cows as we will learn on how to provide and take care of them and their needs
       so that one can gain maximum yield of their products over a long period of time as the saying goes" YOU TAKE CARE OF THEM, THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU."
       <br>
       Our main focus is on cows as they are a common among us farmers but also it is because they have more to return than other animals. 
       They provide products like milk,meat, their skin can be used for manufacturing products like belts and shoes when properly processed, and
        without forgetting they also produce manure which can be used in crop cultivation thus the focus on cows.
        <br>
        In this session, we shall also be able to visit some wonderful ranches where we will kearn more from first hand experiensed livestock keepers and
         we might be able to even engage in some activities such as milking the cows ourselves as they "MAKING OUR HANDS DIRTY".
